        <h2>What is Internet</h2>
        <p>
          The <b>Internet</b> (or <b>Network</b>) is the global system of
          <b>interconnected computer networks</b> that uses the Internet
          protocol suite (<b>TCP/IP</b>) to communicate between networks and
          devices. It is a network of networks that consists of
          <b>private, public, academic, business, and government networks</b> of
          local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic,
          wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a
          vast range of information resources and services, such as the
          interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the
          <b>World Wide Web (WWW)</b>, electronic mail, internet telephony,
          streaming media and file sharing.

      <div id="Service_tiers">
        <h2>Service Tiers</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Internet service providers</b> (ISPs) establish the worldwide
          connectivity between
          <b>individual networks at various levels of scope</b>. End-users who
          only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain
          information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy. At the top
          of the routing hierarchy are the tier 1 networks, large
          telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each
          other via very high speed fiber-optic cables and governed by peering
          agreements. Tier 2 and lower-level networks buy Internet transit from
          other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet,
          though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single
          upstream provider for connectivity, or implement multihoming to
          achieve redundancy and load balancing. Internet exchange points are
          major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs.
          Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises,
          and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in
          peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks.
          Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as
          <b>GEANT, GLORIAD</b>, Internet2, and the UK's national research and
          education network, <b>JANET</b>.

        <p>
          In its simplest terms, its 2 or more computers connected to each
          other. But those 2 computers could be fundamentally different -- for
          example, a phone and a desktop PC. Everything is different in them.
          Now extend this idea to 3 billion devices or even more. To make
          communication possible between these 2 devices, they agree to send and
          receive data in a certain way. This agreement is called a protocol.
          Internet is facilitated extensively via IP or literally, Internet
          Protocol . Over this protocol, we have even more such as HTTP, SMTP,
          and a butt load of alphabet soup.

        <h2>How data is tranferred over computer network?</h2>
        <p>
          Data is transferred over computer networks through the process of
          packet switching, where data is divided into packets, transmitted
          individually, and reassembled at the receiving end. Steps for Data
          Transfer Over Computer Network

      <div id="What_is_IP">
        <h2>What is IP?</h2>
        <p>
          The most prominent component of the Internet model is the
          <b>Internet Protocol (IP)</b>. IP enables internetworking and, in
          essence, establishes the Internet itself. Two versions of the Internet
          Protocol exist, <b>IPv4 and IPv6</b>.
        </p>
        <h2>What is IP Address?</h2>
        <p>
          For locating individual computers on the network, the Internet
          provides <b>IP addresses.</b> IP addresses are used by the Internet
          infrastructure to direct internet packets to their destinations. They
          consist of fixed-length numbers, which are found within the packet. IP
          addresses are generally assigned to equipment either automatically via
          DHCP, or are configured. However, the network also supports other
          addressing systems. Users generally enter domain names (e.g.
          "google.com") instead of IP addresses because they are easier to
          remember; they are converted by the
          <b>Domain Name System (DNS)</b> into IP addresses which are more
          efficient for routing purposes.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>IPv4</h2>
        <p>
          Internet Protocol version 4 (<b>IPv4</b>) defines an IP address as a
          <b>32-bit number</b>. IPv4 is the initial version used on the first
          generation of the Internet and is still in dominant use. It was
          designed in 1981 to address up to <b>≈4.3 billion</b> (109) hosts.
          However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to IPv4 address
          exhaustion, which entered its final stage in 2011,[86] when the global
          IPv4 address allocation pool was exhausted.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/IPv4-address-format.webp" alt="IPV4" height="300"
        width=600">

        <hr />

        <h2>IPv6</h2>
        <p>
          Because of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available
          IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP <b>IPv6</b>, was developed in the
          mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and
          more efficient routing of Internet traffic.
          <b>IPv6 uses 128 bits</b> for the IP address and was standardized in
          1998. IPv6 deployment has been ongoing since the mid-2000s and is
          currently in growing deployment around the world, since Internet
          address registries (RIRs) began to urge all resource managers to plan
          rapid adoption and conversion.

      <div id="DNS">
        <h2>What is Domain Name System (DNS)</h2>
        <p>
          DNS is a hierarchical and distributed naming system that translates
          domain names into IP addresses. When you type a domain name like
          www.geeksforgeeks.org into your browser, DNS ensures that the request
          reaches the correct server by resolving the domain to its
          corresponding IP address.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Purpose:</b> Humans are bad at remembering numbers like
          142.251.42.206. We are good at remembering names like google.com. DNS
          translates human-friendly domain names into machine-friendly IP
          addresses.
        </p>
        <h2>How Does DNS Work?</h2>
        <p>
          The <b>DNS</b> process can be broken down into several steps, ensuring
          that users can access websites by simply typing a domain name into
          their browser.

          A <b>port number</b> is a 16-bit number (ranging from
          <b> 0 to 65535</b>) that identifies a specific application or service
          on a computer network device. While an <b>IP address</b> gets data to
          the correct device, a port number directs that data to the correct
          application, such as a web browser using <b>port 80</b> for HTTP or
          <b>port 443</b> for HTTPS.

        <p>
          <b>Private IP Addresses</b> are those addresses that work within the
          local network. These addresses are non-routable on the Internet. The
          address is assigned by the network router to your particular device.
          The <b>unique private IP address </b>is provided to every device which
          is on the same network. In this way, devices communicate with one
          another on the same network without connecting to the entire Internet.
          <b>Private IP addresses</b> can provide more security within a
          particular network. These addresses cannot be seen on the Internet,
          unlike the <b>public IP address</b>. Only devices within the local
          network can see the address of one another.

          A <b>VPN (Virtual Private Network)</b> is a technology that creates a
          secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet. It
          essentially acts as a private tunnel for your internet traffic,
          preventing hackers, ISPs, and even governments from monitoring your
          activities. When using a <b>VPN</b>, your IP address is masked, and
          your online actions are routed through a remote server, making it
          harder to track your online activity.

            A database is where a website’s data like user's data, product's
            data are stored and organized. It is part of the backend (server

            databases to save and access information like user details, content,
            and transactions. Some databases organize data in tables (called

              spreadsheet, where each table has rows and columns. The rows hold
              individual records, and the columns define the data attributes.
              Tables can be linked to each other through special keys, allowing
              related data to be connected.

              <b>NoSQL Databases</b>
              <p>
                A NoSQL database stores data in a flexible, non-tabular format,
                unlike traditional relational databases. Instead of using tables
                with rows and columns, NoSQL databases might use documents,
                key-value pairs, wide-columns, or graphs to store data. This
                allows them to handle large amounts of unstructured or
                semi-structured data efficiently. They are designed to scale
                easily and manage big data applications.
              </p>

                  <b>MongoDB:</b>MongoDB is a NoSQL database storing data in
                  JSON-like documents. It handles unstructured data, supports
                  powerful queries, and scales easily across servers, making it
                  popular for flexible, scalable applications.
